## Problem 1

``` r
iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

fill_value = function(x) {
  if(is.character(x)) {
   x = replace_na(x, "virginica")
  } else if(is.numeric(x)){
   mean = round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),1)
   x = replace_na(x, mean)
  }
}
iris_new = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, fill_value)
```

## Problem 2

``` r

data = purrr::map_dfr(str_c("./data/", list1), read_csv) %>%

         name = str_replace(name, ".csv", "")
  ) %>%
  separate(name, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>%

Comment: Compared with the control arm group, there is an obviously
increasing trend of observation in the experiment arm group. Overall,
the average values of observations are higher in the experiment arm
group.

## Problem 3

``` r
sim_regression = function(beta1, n = 30, beta0 = 2) {
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
    y = beta0 + beta1 * x + rnorm(n, 0, sqrt(50))
  )
  
  ls_fit = lm(y ~ x, data = sim_data) %>%
    broom::tidy() %>%
    filter(term == "x") %>%
    select(estimate, p.value) %>%
    rename(beta1_hat = estimate,
           p_value = p.value)
}
  
output = vector("list", 10000)

for (i in 1:10000) {
  output[[i]] = sim_regression(beta1 = 0)
}

sim_results = bind_rows(output)
```
