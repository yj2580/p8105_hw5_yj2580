## Problem 1

``` r
iris_with_missing = iris %>% 
  map_df(~replace(.x, sample(1:150, 20), NA)) %>%
  mutate(Species = as.character(Species))

fill_value = function(x) {
  if(is.character(x)) {
   x = replace_na(x, "virginica")
  } else if(is.numeric(x)){
   mean = round(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),1)
   x = replace_na(x, mean)
  }
}
iris_new = map_dfr(iris_with_missing, fill_value)
```

## Problem 2

``` r

data = purrr::map_dfr(str_c("./data/", list1), read_csv) %>%
  mutate(name = list1, 
         name = str_replace(name, ".csv", "")
  ) %>%
  separate(name, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(arm = factor(arm), 
         id = factor(id)) %>%
